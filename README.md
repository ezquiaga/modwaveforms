# Modified waveforms

This repository contains modified waveforms to be used in gravitational wave parameter estimation.

This package interfaces with [bilby](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby) to generate the waveforms.

Currently this package contains the following waveforms:

- Strongly lensed images (including Morse phase)
