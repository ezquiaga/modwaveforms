# Modified waveforms

This repository contains modified waveforms to be used in gravitational wave parameter estimation.

This package interfaces with [bilby](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby) to generate the waveforms.

Currently this package contains the following waveforms:

- Strongly lensed images (including Morse phase)

- Point lens mass in wave optics

## Installation
You can install the package from source code:

### from source
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ezquiaga/modwaveforms.git
$ cd modwaveforms
$ pip install .
```
